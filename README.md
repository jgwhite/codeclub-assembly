# My First Code Club Assembly!

This is the stuff I presented to 300-odd kids at
[De Beauvoir Primary School](http://www.debeauvoir.hackney.sch.uk/)
at morning assmebly on Wednesday 13 March, 2013.

It was super, super fun.

Please re-use the material, assuming you don't find it totally ridiculous.
